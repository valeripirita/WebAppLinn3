# ASP.NET Core: CRUD Using Angular 5 and Entity Framework Core

This web application is built using ASP.NET Core 2.0 and Angular 5.
To read the inputs from the user, we are using Angular Forms with required field validations on the client side.
We are also going to bind a dropdown list in the Angular Form to a table in the database using EF Core.


1) Open project in Visual Studio 2017
2) Solution Explorer: Dependencies => npm => r-click => Restore Packages
3) Wait until finished (check status bar)
4) F5 => should work :)
