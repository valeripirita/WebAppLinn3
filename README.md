# ASP.NET Core: CRUD Using Angular 5 (Without Entity Framework)

This web application is built using ASP.NET Core 2.1 and Angular 5 (actulally 4.8)
To read the inputs from the user, we are using Angular Forms with required field validations on the client side.
We are also going to bind a dropdown list in the Angular Form to a table in the database using EF Core.


1) Open project in Visual Studio 2017
2) Solution Explorer: Dependencies => npm => r-click => Restore Packages
3) Wait until finished (check status bar: "Installing packages" => "Installing packages complete")
4) Ctrl-Shift-B => should build, F5 => should work :)
